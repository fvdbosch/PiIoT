# PiIoT
Repository for my entry in element14's Pi IoT Design Challenge (https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/pi-iot).

For this challenge, I set out to build a smart alarm clock and control unit for my home's automation.
Combining software such as OpenHAB and PocketSphinx with custom scripts, I am able to monitor and control spaces.

A summary of the project including demo can be found here: https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/pi-iot/blog/2016/08/29/pi-iot-alarm-clock-summary
