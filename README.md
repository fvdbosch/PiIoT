# PiIoT
Repository for my entry in element14's Pi IoT Design Challenge (https://www.element14.com/community/community/design-challenges/pi-iot).

For this challenge, I set out to build a smart alarm clock and control unit for my home's automation.
Combining software such as OpenHAB and PocketSphinx with custom scripts, I am able to monitor and control spaces.
