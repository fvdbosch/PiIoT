These files are to be used in combination with the installation described here: http://makezine.com/projects/use-raspberry-pi-for-voice-control/

The main.py script has been adapted and extended to suit my project, along with a bunch of helper scripts.

Helper scripts:

* symbol.py: diplays a custom symbol on an 8x8 LED matrix
* weather.py: retrieves the current and forecasted weather
* response.py: converts a text response to voice
